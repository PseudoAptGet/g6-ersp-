# getting started 
Parts of this project were done in Java, and other parts were done in R. Please see a file by file analysis of what each file does, and which files to configure where. 

# a note about methodology 
In order to have cross-platform transfer of data, and to enable future cohorts to use their favorite languages (even FORTRAN) to build on the existing libraries and output files, we recommend storing outputs on csv files, and then using it for inputs for future programs/scripts. That way, csv files are used in the same manner as JSON in server interactions for web systems.
